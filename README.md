# Simple Arduino Music Visualizer
=================================

This is an example script to create a very simple Arduino-based music visualizer. The software samples audio from a microphone, computes its Fourier transform, and changes the color of an LED strip accordingly.

For build instructions, see this project's [Hackster tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/AlexWulff/super-simple-music-spectrum-visualizer-c99971).
